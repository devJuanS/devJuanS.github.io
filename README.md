This site is where I will be showcasing my work done during my learning path as a Frontend Developer. For now, I'll publish projects I have completed as part of courses or challenges.
This page is being developed following the [Roadmap.sh Frontend Projects](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects):

* [Basic HTML Website](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website)
* [Personal Portfolio](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website)
